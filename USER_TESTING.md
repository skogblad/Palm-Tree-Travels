# User Testing & Evaluation

## Method

- 4 participants
- Task-based testing
- Think-aloud method
- Observation of users

## Key Findings

#### Positive

- Easy navigation
- Clear design and not "too much" (but still good specific with e.g. score on destination result cards)
- Good visualize on which preferens ones have chosen
- Current weather data is great when looking to book a last minute getaway
- The map view make it very simple to see where a destination is located when unsure
- Nice that the search results doesn't disappear when navigating to favorites (also easy to reset)
- Overall a good idea that make it easier to find inspiration and book a trip

#### Improvments

- Not able to click on the whole destination card (only picture and title)
- The destinations cards look a bit stiff in the result list
- Not abel to sort back on % match if sorted on something else
- Should be nice to brows between all destinations, perhaps categorized in places (Europe, South America etc.)
- Connect the "best travel time" for each destination into the search results (either remove destination from results or visualize it somehow to make it more clear)
- Add more pictures of each destination to get a better "feel" of the place

## Reflections

Due to time constraints, not all findings were implemented. But things like stiffness of result card and sort button with score was to make the overall feeling of the website better.

For the future I think it will bring much value to focus on: connect best travel time to results, add more pictures and have one page with all destinations in categories for easy browsing for users that have a lot of time.
