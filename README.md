# Palm Tree Travels

Palm Tree Travels is a web application designed to inspire users to discover warm, palm-worthy travel destinations without needing to choose a specific city or country upfront. Instead of starting with a place, the app focuses on what the user wants to experience — temperature, city vibes, or a particular atmosphere — and uses weather data and relevant destination information to guide personalized suggestions.

Users can freely explore destinations, save their favorites, and quickly gain insights into what each place has to offer. Palm Tree Travels is built to be an intuitive and inspiring tool for anyone looking to discover their next warm getaway in an easy and engaging way.
